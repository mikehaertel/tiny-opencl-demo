This is a minimal OpenCL program to benchmark NxN matrix multiplication
on a GPU.  The matrices are initialized to zero, because this program
is not trying to do anything actually interesting.

It uses the first enumerated GPU on the system, whatever that happens
to be.  It performs *no error checking whatsoever* on the return status
of OpenCL runtime library calls.  It gives no indication of success or
failure other than by consuming time.

The main purpose of this program is to be a cheat sheet / reminder to
myself of how to write a complete OpenCL program.

To build:

	$ make N=<a multiple of 16> matmul

To run:

	$ time ./matmul

It produces no output.
